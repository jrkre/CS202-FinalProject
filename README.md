# Semester Project
**The base level project**
**Zoe Roberts** - Initial UI, Documentation of project, Doxygen generation & UML diagram
**Joshua Knight** - Outline of project, FILE IO components, UI refactoring, Help with processing
**Aaron Bartee** - Help with UI & FILEIO, All processing componenets
**UML**:
**Challenges we encountered**: The challenges we encountered during this project had a lot to do with making sure the processing was done correctly and well, since it is the basic idea behind the app. It took extra time to make sure it was done efficiently and correctly. The FILEIO also took a bit more time to get fully finished and working nicely together.
**For building app.**: run _make_
