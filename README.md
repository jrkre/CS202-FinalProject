# Semester Project
**The base level project**

**Zoe Roberts** - Documentation of project, Doxygen generation, UML diagram, Help with UI

**Joshua Knight** - Outline of project, FILE IO components, UI & refactoring, Help with processing

**Aaron Bartee** - Help with UI & FILEIO, All processing componenets

**UML**:




**Challenges we encountered**: The challenges we encountered during this project had a lot to do with making sure the processing was done correctly and well, since it is the basic idea behind the app. It took extra time to make sure it was done efficiently and smoothly. The FILEIO also took a bit more time to get fully finished and working nicely together. Aside from actual coding elements, we faced the challenge of being very busy with other classwork, jobs, and responsibilities, but nonetheless we got our finished product.

**For building application**: run _make_
